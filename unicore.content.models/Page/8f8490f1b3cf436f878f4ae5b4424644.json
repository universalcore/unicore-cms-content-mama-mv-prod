They will help you to stay well and your baby to grow strong bones and teeth.\r\n\r\nCalcium is a mineral that helps bones and teeth to grow. You need plenty of calcium, because your bones are still growing too. It may also help to reduce the risk of high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nCalcium forms your baby's bones and teeth. It also helps to control the rhythm of his heart. If you are not getting enough calcium, your baby will not go without, but you will. That is because, where minerals are concerned, your body puts your baby first.\r\n\r\nYou can get calcium from:\r\n\r\n - \tCow\u2019s milk and coconut milk\r\n\r\n - \tgreen leafy vegetables\r\n\r\n - \tfish, especially oily fish \r\n\r\nTo help you to absorb calcium, you also need to make sure that you are getting enough vitamin D.
