  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is good, and reassuring, to have health check-ups in the weeks after your baby is born, to make sure both you and your baby are OK. \r\n\r\nVisit the midwife with your baby at least once during week 1 and again when she is 6 weeks old. Remember, boys and girls need the same amount of check-ups.\r\n\r\nTake your baby to a midwife immediately if:\r\n\r\n -  Her belly is too cold or too hot\r\n\r\n -  She develops yellow eyes, hands and feet within the first day of his life\r\n\r\n -  She refuses to feed or sucks poorly\r\n\r\n -  She will not stop crying or if his cry sounds unusual\r\n\r\n -  She has a fit, is drowsy and not moving much, or has bluish skin or nails\r\n\r\n -  She is wheezing, grunting, or breathing quickly \r\n\r\n -  She is vomiting after every feed for more than a day, or has a swollen belly\r\n\r\n -  The area around your baby's cord stump is red or smelly\r\n\r\nThese are signs that your baby is unwell, and needs treatment quickly.\r\n\r\n",
