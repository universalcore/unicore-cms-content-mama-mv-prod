  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nYour baby is growing inside your body just above your bladder (where your water collects before you pass it). The weight of the baby tends to squeeze the bladder, which makes you need to pass water (called urine) more often. This is common in pregnancy. Do not cut down the amount of clean, safe water you drink. You need it to stay healthy.\r\n\r\nIf you find that it is painful when you pass water, you might have an infection. This can give you a high temperature, or make you suddenly feel hot and cold. Other signs of infection are blood in your urine, feeling nauseous, and shaking. Sex might be painful, too.\r\n\r\nGetting treated is very important, so see a health worker. The germs in your urine can give you a kidney infection, which can be serious for you and your baby\u2019s health.\r\n\r\nYou can also help to prevent urine infections.\r\n\r\n - \tAfter going to the toilet, always wipe from 'front' to 'back', or pour water from front to back, or wash with soap.\r\n\r\n - \tDrink lots of clean, safe water. This will help to wash out infections.\r\n\r\n - \tIf you need to pass water, go! Do not hold it in.\r\n\r\nAlways pass water after sex, if you can, to get rid of any germs.\r\n\r\n",
